# SC Shortname

Pointer inputs with additional sensors

# SC Text

All pointer functionality can be operated using screen coordinate information, without requiring additional pointer sensor information.

Note 1: Additional sensor information includes pointer pressure (for instance on pressure-sensitive touch screens), pointer tilt or/and pointer twist (for instance on advanced pen/stylus digitizers).

# Suggestion for Priority Level (A/AA/AAA)

Level A

# Related Glossary additions or changes

Pointer inputs: input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen, such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact. (modified slightly from https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#glossary)

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new* Guideline "Additional sensor inputs"

# Description

Some pointer input devices provide sensors to detect - beyond simple x/y screen coordinates - additional values such as twist, tilt, pressure. Not all users may have these advanced pointer input devices (e.g. users may have a touch screen, but not a pressure-sensitive touch screen), OR they may have the device, but may be unable to operate the advanced functionality (at all, or precisely enough).

[Editorial comment: this may be seen as a deepening/clarification of 2.5.1; also, 2.1.1/2.1.3 are of course also still valid, so beyond dropping down from "advanced" to "non-advanced" pointer, functionality must also be operable with just the keyboard]

# Benefits

Users who can use a pointer, but lack dexterity to perform precise movements such as twist, tilt and pressure would not be able to perform functions unless they can be done with simple pointer input.

# Testability

Test each function with a simple pointer (no pressure, tilt, ext of the pointer)

# Techniques

Functionality/content must not solely rely on advanced pointer input information (e.g. an alternative which does not require advanced sensors, but just plain x/y screen coordinate information only, must be available)

[Note: the techniques M3 and M9 are related and may be combined in 2.1. M3 requires that functionality work without timing or multi gestures, M9 requires it works without tilt, specific pressure, or angle, etc...]
