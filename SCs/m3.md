# SC Shortname

Pointer gestures

# SC Text

All functionality can be operated without requiring precise/timed pointer gestures or multi-pointer gestures.

Note 1: examples of a multi-pointer gesture include two-finger pinch/zoom
Note 2: this requirement applies to web content which interprets pointer gestures (i.e. this does not apply to gestures that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology)

Pointer inputs: input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen, such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact. (modified slightly from https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#glossary)

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new* Guideline "Pointer Accessible"

# Description

It may not always be possible for users to perform specific gestures (e.g. draw a complex path with their finger on a touchscreen) in a precise and timely manner - they may lack the precision/accuracy/speed necessary. Further, it may not always be possible for users to perform multi-pointer gestures (e.g. a two-finger pinch/zoom, three-finger rotation). Authors must ensure that their content/functionality can be operated without requiring the user to perform specific gestures.

Note: this does not preclude the inclusion of gesture-based interactions; however, if gesture-based controls are used, then a non-gesture-based alternative which only requires a single activation/tap must be present.

# Benefits

Users who cannot (accurately) perform pointer gestures (such as touchscreen swipes or multi-pointer gestures such as a two-finger pinch/zoom) will be able to operate content/functionality.

# Testability

Manual test: if a web site/application provides gesture-based controls, ensure that non-gesture-based alternatives are available.

# Techniques

Don't rely solely on pointer gestures that require high precision or specific timings; don't rely on multi-pointer gestures; provide alternatives that do not require gestures (e.g. additional visible controls that perform the same/similar action as a quick flick/swipe) and alternatives that only require a single pointer, rather than multi-pointer.

[Note: the techniques M3 and M9 are related and may be combined in 2.1. M3 requires that functionality work without timing or multi gestures, M9 requires it works without tilt, specific pressure, or angle, etc...]
