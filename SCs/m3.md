# SC Shortname

Pointer gestures

# SC Text

All functionality can be operated without requiring  complex or timed pointer gestures or multi-pointer gestures.

Note 1: Examples of a multi-pointer gesture include two-finger pinch/zoom

Note 2: This requirement applies to web content which interprets pointer gestures (i.e. this does not apply to gestures that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology)

# Suggestion for Priority Level (A/AA/AAA)

Pointer inputs: input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen, such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact. (modified slightly from https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#glossary)

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new* Guideline "Pointer Accessible"

# Description

It may not always be possible for users to perform specific gestures (e.g. draw a complex path with their finger on a touchscreen) in a precise and timely manner - they may lack the precision/accuracy/speed necessary. Further, it may not always be possible for users to perform multi-pointer gestures (e.g. a two-finger pinch/zoom, three-finger rotation). Authors must ensure that their content/functionality can be operated without requiring the user to perform timed or complex gestures.

Note: this does not preclude the inclusion of gesture-based interactions; however, if gesture-based controls are used, then an alternative which only requires a single activation/tap must be present.

# Benefits

Users who cannot (accurately) perform complex or timed pointer gestures (such as touchscreen swipes or multi-pointer gestures such as a two-finger pinch/zoom) will be able to operate content/functionality.

# Testability

Manual test: if a web site/application has controls that accept complex or timed pointer gestures, ensure that the functionality can be operated via alternative simple controls that can be activated by a simple pointer gesture (such as tapping or a mouse click).

# Techniques

Do not rely solely on complex pointer gestures that require high precision or specific timings; do not rely on multi-pointer gestures; provide alternatives that do not require complex gestures (e.g. additional visible controls that perform the same function as a complex gesture and can be activated by a simple pointer gesture (mouse click, tap).

[Note: the techniques M3 and M9 are related and may be combined in 2.1. M3 requires that functionality work without timing or multi gestures, M9 requires it works without tilt, specific pressure, or angle, etc...]
